Present Tense:
  Unlike English language, Norwegian language does not have the progressive form for present (present continuous: is drinking). The form of the verb is the same, and it is form by adding ’r’ to infinitive.
 
      drikke+ r = drikker
      snakke + r = snakker
      reise + r= reiser

      Jeg drikker kaffe hver dag. (I drink coffe every day.)
      Jeg drikker kaffe nå. (I am drinking coffe now.)
